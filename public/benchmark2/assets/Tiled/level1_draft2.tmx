    <property name="info" value="Off the coast of Florida covering the seafloor are many meadows of seagrass. This plant often grows at shallower depths so it can feed off of light from the sun. Like land plants, seagrasses produce oxygen and are a source of food for many sea creatures including fish, crabs, and sea turtles. Because of their importance to ocean ecosystems around the world, efforts are in place to protect these underwater meadows."/>
